        <h2>History of JOHOR BAHRU</h2>
        <p>Today, Johor remains the nation's largest trade contributor among all Malaysian states. The state is also a
            major logistics hub in Malaysia, home to the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, the 15th busiest port in the
            world.Founded by Mahmud Shah, the fugitive sultan of Malacca (now spelled Melaka), and his son Alauddin
            after the Malaccan kingdom fell to the Portuguese (1511), the area declined in the 18th century when the
            seat of power shifted to the Riau (Riouw) islands (now part of Indonesia), south of Singapore.</p>

            <h3>Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Glass Temple</h3>
            <p>This temple, which is one of the oldest Hindu temples in Johor Bahru, is situated next to the railway
                tracks between Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and Jalan Mohd Taib, near the Tebrau Highway. It was established
                in 1922 as a simple shelter on land presented by the Sultan of Johor.
                In 1991, Sri Sinnathamby Sivasamy, who is currently temple chairman and chief priest, also known as Guru
                Bhagawan Sittar inherited the administration of the temple from his father. He has been the driving
                force behind the temple's renovation and expansion, committing to rebuilding it from the humble hut that
                it once was. Despite facing challenges and difficulties, the temple was rebuilt and officially reopened
                in 1996.</p>
